FreeAgent API
=============

This is just a simple wrapper around the FreeAgent[1] API. The motivation is that I wanted to be able to deal with multiple FreeAgent accounts; most other approaches use ActiveResource-esque mappings that link Projects (for example) to a single account.

Example use:

  require 'rubygems'
  require 'free_agent'
  
  Lazyatom = FreeAgent::Company.new("mydomain", "me@email.com", "mypassword")
  
  # All my contacts
  Lazyatom.contacts.all
  
  # All my unpaid invoices
  Lazyatom.invoices.reject { |i| i.paid? }
  
  # All the timeslips for a project
  Lazyatom.projects.first.timeslips.all

It's early days yet, but this is a nice start.
